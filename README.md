### An Evaluation of Salary, Promotion, and Hiring Process at Black Saber Software
#### Evidence of Gender Bias in Salary
#### Report prepared for Black Saber Software by Calabash Brothers Solutions

### Executive summary
Over the past few months, several software companies had received bad press about their hiring
and remuneration processes, during which human bias are present. As a consequence, people
have been raising concerns about potential bias in the recruitment and promotion process of
Black Saber Software. Experts in our advisory and consulting group are hired to ensure the
client company is out ahead of any potential such issues. This study following set out to assess
whether the client company exhibits a bias against female in hiring, as well as 2013-2020 salary
and promotion.

#### Results are summarized below.

• The gender bias are not present in the hiring process. In Figure 1, there is no obvious
difference in the ratio of being selected for male and female. Females and males have equal
opportunities to be selected during the recruiting including AI selection and interviews.
Neither men nor women are more favorable.

• In Phase I of the recruitment process, individuals who have higher GPA or those who have
demonstrated some work experience in the past are more likely to be automatically selected
by the AI to the next round. However, surprisingly, young professionals who have rich
extracurricular experiences do not seem to have a notifiable advantage in the first round of
the hiring.

• In Phase II of the hiring, GPA and work experience are no longer a factor that will have
an effect on the selection process. Instead, the evaluation of individuals focus on technical
skills as well as other soft skills such as writing skills, speaking skills and leadership skills.

• In Phase III of the hiring, the most influencing factor is the rating of two interviewers. By
analyzing data of acceptance and rejection during interview, there is still no gender bias
observed.

• Overall, current male employees have higher salary compared to their female counterparts
who have the same role seniority under the same department (see Figure 2). Female
employees are not paid with the same amount salaries even if they have the same amount
of workloads as male employees
